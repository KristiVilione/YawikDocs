About YAWIK
===========

YAWIK offers a web based solution for managing job applications. Jobs ads can be entered or pushed to the system. 
The system assigns application forms to job ads. Applicants and Recruiters can connect to YAWIK using social 
networks. Currently it is possible to integrate YAWIK into a corporate website by extending it with an own module (see :ref:`customize`). 
On the long term it is designed to become a distributed system for connecting recruiters and applicants.

the application module offers an application formular, a list of application and
a detail view of an application. Depending on the users privileges the detail 
view offers a way to invite or reject an applicant, to rate an application or to 
forward an application by email.

If the :ref:`PDF` Module is installed, the Application can be downloaded as a PDF 
document with Attachments and social profiles embedded.

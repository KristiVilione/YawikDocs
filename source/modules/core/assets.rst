Assets
^^^^^^

Assets are common JS like bootstrap_ or select2_. It makes sense to manage these assets by npm_.

You can download all required JS files by:


.. code-block:: SH

  npm install
  bin/install-assets.sh

this will copy all needed JS files into ``public/assets``

.. _select2: https://www.npmjs.com/package/select2

    <br/>translation state of Orders module.
    </div>

the order module adds a storage for orders. By submitting a job posting, an order is created. The order contains all
relevant data needed for billings. In addition, the module adds an invoice formular, which can be added into the order
process. Default values of the invoice formular can be set in Settings/Orders.

Technically, the oder module offers the feature to take a snapshot of an entify.

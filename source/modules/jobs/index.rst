The Jobs module allows to enter and manage job ads. In addition it generates a 
list of jobs. List of Jobs can be generated in a recruiter (:ref:`recruiter-mode`) 
and a public search (:ref:`search-mode`) mode

    Public Search Mode

in search mode the users only see published jobs. This is normally used as a list of
current vacancies, which is often used on a corporate website.

The list mode is defined by the users role.

It is also possible to configure YAWIK to run as a jobboard. There is a `jobboard
module`_ which lets YAWIK act like a jobboard. This module is running on

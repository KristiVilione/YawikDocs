Applicants refer to Organization Names in their work history. Job Postings require an Organization Name. Either
the name of the hiring Organization or the name of an agency. A Recruiter has to assign himself to an Organization.

Organization Names are just Names. They are public. Organization Names are assigned to various ratings. If an
Organization Name is used as an hiring Organization for a job posting, or if a recruiter is using an Organization
name for it's own company, the ranking is modified.

An Organization entity itself only contains a reference to an organization Name.
